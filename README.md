# Makima - A University Static Website CV Project

### Introduction

Welcome to my static website CV project for Makima ! This project was created as part of my first year in a computer science degree program. For this project, I was only allowed to use HTML and CSS and was not allowed to use JavaScript.
As this is my first experience creating a static website CV, it may not be to everyone's taste, but I have done what I could with a period of time given.

### Project Description

Makima, from the manga "Chainsaw Man" by Tatsuki Fujimoto, is the inspiration for this static website CV project. The website includes the following sections:

- Personal Information : a brief introduction to Makima, including her name, age, and background.
- Motivation : Makima's personal mission statement and career goals.
- Education : a summary of Makima's academic achievements and degrees.
- Work Experience : a detailed list of Makima's work history, including job titles, company names, and descriptions of her responsibilities and accomplishments.
- Skills: an overview of Makima's key skills and abilities, such as leadership, strategy, and negotiation.
- Interests : a list of Makima's hobbies and interests outside of work, such as reading, cooking, and traveling.
- External Profiles : links to Makima's profiles on external platforms.
  The website includes a header, footer, and a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate between the different sections. The website also features a form for contacting Makima directly.

### Design and Development

To make the website visually appealing and user-friendly, I used a consistent color scheme, typography, and layout throughout the website.
Although this is my first experience creating a static website CV, I tried my best to use the best practices for web development, such as using semantic and accessible HTML markup, using CSS transitions and flex/grid layout, and ensuring the website meets the W3C standards.

### Getting Started

To use the Makima-themed static website CV project, you can simply clone or download the code from my GitHub repository. As this is a project for a university course, you can also use it as a reference for your own coursework or for inspiration for your own static website CV project.
